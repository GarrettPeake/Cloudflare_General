wrangler login using oauth had CORS errors
    Running in curl had 500 internal server error
generating workers api keys had errors

Revelations:
    Workers don't have cold starts!
    Pages offers the same features with higher caps than Netlify
    I wish there was a database with get put like KV but JSON depth like Mongo or DynamoDB
